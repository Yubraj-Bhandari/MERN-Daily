"Day 1 learning notes go here" 

Topic 1: How the Internet Works
kJ Brief History: Web 1.0 → Web 3.0


Web 1.0 (1990s – early 2000s) – The "Read-Only" Wed
L Websites were static with no interactivity*
L Built using HTML and CSS (no JavaScript)*
L Users could only read content; there was no user engagement*
L No social media or real-time interactions*
L Example: Early Yahoo! pages, simple blogs.


 Web 2.0 (2004 – Present) – The "Read-Write" Wed
L Enabled dynamic and interactive experiences*
L Technologies like AJAX and JavaScript allowed live updates without page
reloads*
L Social media, e-commerce, and cloud applications emerged*
L Users could generate content (comments, reviews, blog posts, real-time chats)*
L Example: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Amazon.


 Web 3.0 (Emerging) – The "Decentralized" Wed
L Uses blockchain technology to ensure decentralization*
L AI-driven and privacy-focused to give users more control over data*
L Example: Cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, decentralized apps (Ethereum,
Filecoin)


SA Basics of Computer Communication & Data Transmission


Data Transmission & PacketL
C The internet sends data in packets, which are small chunks of informationb
C Each packet has4
C Header (destination and sender information)b
C Payload (actual data being transferred)b
C Uses TCP/IP protocols to ensure data reaches the right destination.


 Two Types of CommunicatioN
C Wired (Ethernet, Fiber Optics) – More stable and faster; used in officesb
C Wireless (Wi-Fi, 5G) – Provides flexibility but can be slower

vQ Domain Names, IP Addresses, MAC Addresses, and Routing


IP Address (Internet Protocol AddressC
R A unique number assigned to every internet-connected devicec
R IPv4 (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) has 4.3 billion addressesc
R IPv6 provides a larger address space for the future.


 MAC Address (Media Access ControlC
R A unique identifier assigned to a device’s network adapterc
R Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5Ec
R Used within local networks but not on the broader internet.


 Domain Names (Example: www.google.comC
R Human-friendly names mapped to IP addresses via DNS (Domain Name
System)c
R DNS servers resolve domain names into IP addresses.


 Routinr
R Routers and gateways direct traffic efficientlyc
R Packets take different routes to reach the destination efficiently


Topic 1: How the Internet Works
jc Overview of ISP & DNS Functionality


 Internet Service Providers (ISP<
b Companies like Jio, Airtel, BSNL provide internet access_
b They act as intermediaries between users and the global internet.


 How DNS WorkF
b A user types www.google.com in a browser_
b The browser contacts a DNS server to get the IP address_
b The DNS translates the domain into an IP (e.g., 142.250.183.206)_
b The browser connects to the website’s server using the IP
Topic 2: Client-Server Architecture
C. Introduction to the Client-Server Model


 What is a ClientR
/ A user’s device (computer, phone, tablet) that requests data from a serverK
/ Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps.


 What is a ServerR
/ A powerful computer that stores and delivers content or servicesK
/ Examples: Web servers, API servers, database servers.


 Example:
A client is like a customer at a restaurant, and the server is like a waiter bringing food
from the kitchen.

Y= HTTP Request/Response Cycle


How It WorkS
> Client sends a request (e.g., GET /index.html)3
> Server processes the request3
> Server responds with data3
> Client displays the content.


 HTTP MethodS
> GET → Retrieve data3
> POST → Send data (forms, logins)3
> PUT → Update data3
> DELETE → Remove data.


 Example:
A restaurant order – You (client) order pizza (GET), the kitchen (server) prepares it,
and you receive it
